SDK for good ol' GP2X
=====================

(Nearly all) these packages depend on kernel sources and libraries for GP2X,
which are nearly 65 MB in size and which are currently nearly unfindable on the
internet and the only one mirror I found is slow as hell. That's the reason
they aren't available in AUR (also because they are ugly and "just working").

 * gp2xsdk-binutils
 * gp2xsdk-gcc
 * gp2xsdk-gcc-prebuild
 * gp2xsdk-glibc
 * gp2xsdk-libs

Temporary packages
==================

Everything other are temporary, ugly or not working / unfinished packages.
